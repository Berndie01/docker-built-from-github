    inputs:
      name:
        # Friendly description to be shown in the UI instead of 'name'
        description: 'Git to Docker'
        # Default value if no value is explicitly provided
        default: 'github.repository'

# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# GitHub recommends pinning actions to a commit SHA.
# To get a newer version, you will need to update the SHA.
# You can also reference a tag or branch, but the action may change without warning.
